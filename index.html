    <p>Hello everyone!

        I am from Liberia, West Africa, and currently living in Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia.
         I am a returned missionary, and I served in the Nigeria Lagos Mission. I am currently
         a senior student. I previously took this course but had to drop it due to circumstances
         beyond my control. However, I am hopeful and prayerful that this time I will successfully complete
        the course.
        
        I am excited to be taking this course and look forward to learning more about the basics, which will
         be beneficial in future related courses.
    </p>
