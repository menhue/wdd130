      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[This website aims to raise awareness among the younger generation about the dangers of substance abuse. Harmful drugs damage the mind and body,
         dulling the senses and impairing critical thinking. This harm undermines the potential for a healthy and productive future, often leaving users 
         disconnected from reality and unaware of the long-term consequences. By highlighting these dangers, the website seeks to guide young individuals
         toward healthier choices, protecting their well-being and preserving their future.]</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[This website is specifically designed to resonate with the younger generation, addressing them directly to make a positive impact on their 
         choices and futures. Through engaging content, relatable language, and accessible information, it aims to educate and encourage young people 
        to avoid harmful substances and prioritize their well-being.]</p>

        [Welcome to my personal site! I’m James Leenue Kennedy, a passionate Applied Technology student born and raised in Monrovia, Liberia.
         My journey into technology began in high school, where I was captivated by the wave of technological innovations shaping the world. 
         I realized how transformative technology could be—not just for individuals, but for entire communities. This inspired me to pursue a
          career in technology, where I aim to contribute to innovation and help create solutions that bring success and growth.]

      <p>With my deep passion for education and technology, I am committed to giving back to the younger generation. I aim to empower high school students by integrating technology into their education,
         teaching them foundational technological skills alongside their standard high school curriculum. My goal is to inspire and prepare them to thrive in a world increasingly shaped by innovation.
         Would you like to expand on how you plan to achieve this, such as through workshops, mentorship programs, or online resources? Let me know how else I can assist!
